<h1>About me</h1>
<p style="font-size: large; word-spacing: 10;" >Hi, I am a computer science engineer from GEC Thrissur with a strong passion for technology, problem-solving, and innovation. <br>

    Beyond academics, I’ve been actively involved in organizing events, having served on the sponsorship committee for Proxy, a department initiative of our batch. <br> My final-year project, InTrainer, was an application designed for interview training, reflecting my enthusiasm for developing practical solutions. 
    
    <br>Outside of work, I’m an avid MMA practitioner, always pushing my limits and embracing new challenges. Whether it’s coding, or honing my skills in combat sports, <br> I thrive on continuous learning and growth.
    
    Let’s connect and build something amazing together!
